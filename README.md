This project was made to automate the process of randomly picking Chinese characters I want to study. Every time I got back to studying my writing I began from the beginning of the list, which resulted in over studying first few hundreds of the characters and not reaching further ones. This program convieniently creates a list of mastered characters and bases on the .xlsx file input with the list of words to master. For now progam:
1. Picks a random character from the list,
2. checks if it's in the mastered list,
3. if not then the character is added to 5 daily characters to study,
4. process repeats until 5 characters are added.

TODO:
1. Make the program universal for any word list. (changes in HSK? my level improving?)
2. Make GUI?
